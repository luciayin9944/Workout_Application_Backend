# Flask_SQLAlchemy_Workout_Application_Backend

This project is a robust backend API for a Workout Tracking Application, built to help personal trainers create, manage, and track workout routines and their associated exercises. Developed with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Marshmallow, the application demonstrates key backend development practices such as defining model relationships, seeding data, validating requests, and maintaining clean, modular code architecture.
